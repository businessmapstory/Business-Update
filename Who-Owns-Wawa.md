Wawa, Inc. is a privately held company with a unique ownership structure that combines family heritage and employee participation. The company's ownership is divided between the Wood family, who hold approximately 59%, and Wawa employees, who own about 41% through the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).

Family Ownership

The Wood family's involvement with Wawa dates back to 1902 when George Wood founded the Wawa Dairy Farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. This dairy farm laid the foundation for what would become the Wawa convenience store chain. Over the years, the Wood family maintained a significant stake in the company, ensuring that its values and vision were preserved. Today, the family continues to play an active role in Wawa's operations and strategic direction.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)

In 1992, Wawa introduced the ESOP, allowing employees to become partial owners of the company. This plan was designed to align the interests of employees with the company's success, fostering a culture of shared responsibility and mutual benefit. Through the ESOP, employees are awarded stock based on their service, with the plan now accounting for more than 40% of Wawa's stock.

Leadership

Wawa's leadership includes CEO Chris Gheysens and Chairman George Wood, reflecting the ongoing involvement of the Wood family in guiding the company's growth and operations. 

This blend of family ownership and employee participation has contributed to Wawa's reputation as a company deeply rooted in its community and committed to its workforce.
