**Who Owns Rap Snacks?**

Rap Snacks, a snack food company that uniquely blends hip-hop culture with flavorful snacks, was founded in 1994 by James Lindsay, a Miami-based entrepreneur. Lindsay's vision was to create a snack brand that resonated with the hip-hop community, featuring collaborations with prominent artists such as Cardi B, Migos, Lil Boosie, Rick Ross, Master P, and Romeo. This approach has positioned Rap Snacks as a leading hip-hop-themed snack product over the past decades.

**James Lindsay: The Visionary Founder**

A native of Philadelphia, James Lindsay graduated from Cheyney University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing. He honed his marketing skills while serving as a manager in the consumer products industry for Johnson Products, an ethnic hair care company, and Warner-Lambert. Leveraging his background, Lindsay founded Rap Snacks, Inc. in 1994, introducing a snack line that celebrated hip-hop cultureâ€”a first of its kind in the U.S. The brand's initial success included a co-marketing agreement with Universal Records, featuring artists on Rap Snacks bags, and expanding into a $5 million business.

**Master P's Involvement**

In 2017, Percy "Master P" Miller joined Rap Snacks as a limited partner. His involvement expanded the product line into noodles, breakfast cereals, and rice through a partnership called P&J Foods. Master P's entrepreneurial expertise and deep ties to the hip-hop industry have been instrumental in Rap Snacks' growth and cultural relevance.

**Expansion and Product Diversification**

Under Lindsay's leadership, Rap Snacks has diversified its offerings beyond traditional chips. The company now produces a variety of snack products, including noodles, breakfast cereals, rice, and beverages like the 5-flavored lemonade line, Oowee Lemonade, in collaboration with Lil' Baby. These expansions reflect Rap Snacks' commitment to innovation and meeting consumer demands.

**Cultural Impact and Recognition**

Rap Snacks has not only provided unique snack flavors but has also played a significant role in honoring cultural icons. In February 2025, the company launched Crum chips, paying tribute to George Crum, the Black chef credited with inventing the potato chip. This initiative highlights Rap Snacks' dedication to acknowledging and celebrating Black history and contributions.

**Conclusion**

James Lindsay remains the founder and CEO of Rap Snacks, with Master P serving as a limited partner. Their combined vision and leadership have transformed Rap Snacks into a culturally significant brand that celebrates hip-hop heritage while offering innovative snack products. The company's journey reflects a successful fusion of entrepreneurship, cultural representation, and community engagement.
