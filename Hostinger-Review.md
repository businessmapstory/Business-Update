<h3 id="ember180" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Hostinger Review: 2025</h3>
<p id="ember181" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">One of the most important decisions a website owner can make is which hosting company they're going to use to put their website online. One hosting company that is very popular is Hostinger. It's got an excellent score on Trustpilot. If you take a look on YouTube, there are many people that recommend it. Why do I like Hostinger so much? My recommendation for the best beginner web hosting is Hostinger. Hostinger, however, wins for best hosting company. Hostinger stands out as one of the best web hosting providers with a set of features that are hard to beat.</p>
<p id="ember182" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Hi, it's jacks here from Brainstorm Force, and I've been setting up websites for over 15 years. I've used many hosting companies during that time. In this blog, we're going to take a deep dive into Hostinger to find out why it's got such good reviews and why it's recommended by so many people.</p>
<h3 id="ember183" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">What in this Review</h3>
<p id="ember184" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Hostinger is often talked about as a good balance between performance and budget, and this is true. It makes it a perfect choice, one of the best choices for people that have multiple small websites. But that's.</p>
<p id="ember185" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Not to say that it's just for people with small websites. Hostinger does also host some big websites and some e-commerce websites, and they have plans available to meet those higher-end needs. So in this blog, to help you decide if Hostinger is the best hosting company for you, I'm going to be taking a look at five key areas.</p>

<p id="ember195" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Um, let me just get rid of Cody here.</p>
<p id="ember196" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Okay, so their most popular plan, well, according to them, is their Business plan, which is $3.99 a month, and you get three months free for that. You should be aware...</p>
<p id="ember197" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">that this pricing is for the 48 Monon term and this is often the case that you get the best deal if you go for a longer term when you sign up for hosting remember you can get a further 10% discount on these prices using our code which I'll put up on the uh blog now and you'll also find it in the description below so on the lowest plan which is called premium so it still sounds pretty good uh which is $299 a month on a 48-month term well you get quite a lot you get 100 websites that you can set up you can have up to</p>
<p id="ember198" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">25,000 visits monthly you get a load of storage 100 gigabytes which is 400,000 files and directories which sounds like quite a lot you also get a free domain so if you haven't got a domain already you can register one for free although you will have to pay for it when it renews and you get a free uh website migration you get the SSL you get the weekly backups and yeah basically a lot of stuff that you would expect you get unlimited bandwidth which is good so uh you're not going to run out of bandwidth</p>
<p id="ember199" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">there what you don't get on the uh Premium plan is the free CDN the staging tool the dedicated IP address or the priority support for that you'd need to go for their Cloud plan where you get all of that stuff um included for the $7.99 a month however I think the best plan and it's the most popular according to uh hosting um it's the business plan where you get um the free CDN and you get the WordPress uh staging tool and you get a little bit more extra space and you can have more monthly visits I</p>
<p id="ember200" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">think for most of you the uh the business plan is going to be the one so it's great value you get a lot of features and pretty much everything you need to get up and running with WordPress remember to keep in mind that these prices are the introductory uh offer prices that you get on new hosting they are going to go up when you renew so for example this one's going to go up to $8.99 a month and this one would go up to $7.99 a month this is standard practice with hosting companies they all put their prices up on renewal and in</p>
<p id="ember201" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">fact although this is quite a considerable price rise it's it's more than double it's not as much as some of the others that can put your price up even more this is why it's very important to make sure you sign up for as long as possible on the initial pricing and make sure you use that discount code that's in the description.</p>
<h3 id="ember202" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Hostinger Performance</h3>
<p id="ember203" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">So next up let's take a look at the performance and uptime you can expect with hostinger so I've set up a very simple WordPress website I've installed Astra along with a starter template and</p>
<p id="ember204" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">I then ran the site through the Google page speed tool if you're not aware of the Google page speed measurement tool it's basically a a little tool that you can run your website through and it gives you a score out of 100 with 100 being the best I got to say I was really pleased with the results I got a score of 94 for the mobile site and a score of 96 on the desktop site which is really good because I haven't installed any performance plugins which would push this score up even higher it's just</p>

<p id="ember207" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">straight out of the box using just the light speeed object caching that come with the hosting hosting the next thing I looked into was the uptime now uptime is obviously how often the servers go down or how often websites go offline and the higher this number the better hosting a promise a uptime of 99.9% which is very high which means basically your website's very rarely going to go offline however I looked into it in a bit more detail there's a company called pingdom that have been monitoring hostinger since 2017 and they</p>
<p id="ember208" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">publish what they find in terms of monitoring the uptime and if you take a look at the numbers you'll see that most months they hit 100% uptime and on the other months where they don't hit 100% it's something very high like 99.97% or 99.98% so occasionally there's a tiny little bit of downtime for maybe one or two minutes in the month but that's it and that's pretty impressive and that's well above average compared to other hosting companies next</p>
<h3 id="ember209" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Hostinger Easy to Use</h3>
<p id="ember210" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">let's take a look at the hosting control panel it's called H panel and it's quite similar to C panel so if you've used that you're going to have no problem problem here in fact even if you haven't used cpanel I think you're going to be absolutely fine it's really easy to use it's quick and easy to set up websites with WordPress or set up some email accounts or adjust your performance settings it's all easy let's jump on the computer let's take a look here is the hosting uh H panel the control panel this is where you do everything that you need to do with your</p>

<p id="ember212" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">hosting this is the uh the dashboard the homepage gives you an overview of what's going on in your account next You' got the websites so these are all the websites that you've set up on your hosting a hosting it's really easy to add a new one just click add website choose what kind of website you want I'd imagine it would be a WordPress website give that a click you then can set some options you can generate your WordPress password just by clicking on these um fre Little Stars if you click next you can decide</p>
<p id="ember213" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">what type of website you want to build let's say a business and services website you then got some of these pre-built websites to choose from or you can choose a theme to install and of course you'll want to install Astra theme you can then click next you can then um choose to install some recommended plugins WP forms is good all in one SEO is pretty good too although I think I prefer rankmath but yeah you can choose which ones you want or you can deselect all of them and put them on later and you click next here is where you can</p>
<p id="ember214" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">enter your domain name of course you do get a free domain name with hosting it if you haven't got one already or you can use a temporary domain name if you haven't decided on one just yet I'm going to click that for now and then hostinger will go away and install WordPress for you and that only took a few minutes now we've got WordPress installed ready to go can easily uh access the admin panel just by clicking on that button there and you got a few other options here so you can go into the file manager you can manage</p>
<p id="ember215" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">your databases you got everything need right here let me just show you some of the other options you've got down the left hand side here so you got some WordPress options here there's even an AI troubleshooter you got some Security Options here so you can keep your WordPress up to date with their auto update service and yeah basically tells you what's installed whether it's secure it's really good way to just to get a top down view of what's going on in terms of security with your website down here you got your hosting plan</p>
<p id="ember216" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">details you can see how many or how much resources you've been using next we've got the performance section so here you got your object cache I mean generally you're going to want to leave all this as it is you can adjust the uh light speed settings if you want you know you can put it up to Advanced or aggressive that will give you even more performance but it may break your website so just be careful if you're going to use this generally I think you're fine Advanced one shouldn't break anything the H panels even got built in</p>
<p id="ember217" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">analytics of course there's not going to be much data on here really but uh once your website starts getting traffic you can get some information about that traffic in here there's also a built in malware scanner which is in the security section basically going to regularly scan your website for malware let you know if there's any problems next we've got the emails so you do get some email accounts with your hosting you can set them up here or you can upgrade to their uh business starter email um VPS is not</p>
<p id="ember218" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">something you're probably going to want right now and the rest is your billing and then there's the marketplace if you want to buy some other services but as you can see really easy really clear really straightforward I mean once You' got your website set up you're probably not going to need to come in here too often but getting a website set up and and configuring it is just a breeze super easy and super quick.</p>
<h3 id="ember219" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Hostinger Technical Support</h3>
<p id="ember220" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The next thing that I investigated with hosting uh was their support this is of course a very important part of Hosting because sometimes things go wrong and when they do you want to know that there's someone there that can help you resolve those problems and get your website back up and running and working correctly as quickly as possible hostinger don't offer telephone support but they do offer a live chat service so I thought I would test it out by breaking my website and then well reaching out to them via the live chat and well see for yourself here's what happened so to test out the hostinger support what I'm going to do is I'm</p>
<p id="ember221" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">going to break this website here and just see how quickly they they help me out and get us back up and running again so what I'm going to do to break the website is I've got a few updates that need to be um done here what I'm going to do is I'm going to run these updates and then uh while it's updating I'm going to do that basically move away from the page and now my website is stuck on this page I can't do anything can't get back into uh WP admin if I just do this it's just stuck on this briefly</p>
<p id="ember222" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">unavailable for scheduled maintenance it's a kind of common WordPress error if you have a problem with an update so let's fire up the hostinger chat and see what they say okay so here's the hosting H panel to access support there's a little chat down here we select the topic it's a website problem let's select the domain it's the light gray seahorse now the AI has detected the error so I guess I could um use this but let's try and see if a real person can can help me out here so I'm going to click I need assistance just because I</p>
<p id="ember223" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">want to see how quickly they respond hi I'm getting if I can type we'll be fine an error when trying to access my website think a can I not type okay let's see wait and see what happens oh here we go I think a plug-in update failed can you help so it says that they typically reply in under a minute so um I'm going to wait for under a minute and we'll see if we get a reply I'm getting a message here from Cody saying that um it's to do with lacking an SSL certificate which obviously isn't a problem so I'm going</p>
<p id="ember224" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">to reply again let's say I think it's a WordPress problem now I'm guessing that Cody is a bot of some kind so I don't know is it going to put me through to a real person that's what I'm hoping for I need further assistance it says try deactivating the problematic plugin um or or by accessing the files directly through hosting control panel that's not going to work I know that from my experience I I know that it's just a little modification that needs to happen I think to the um con. PHP file we'll find</p>
<p id="ember225" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">out I want to speak to a person I'm going to say come on Cody put me through okay so I'm being put through I mean I've been talking to the bot for a couple of minutes which is is fine I guess it's just to um to manage the cue of people waiting can't all be put through straight away to a human otherwise they' be too busy and I guess with the majority of problems this um this bot would probably be able to fix a lot of them especially if it is just deactivating a dodgy plugin it takes you for exactly what you need to do um to do</p>
<p id="ember226" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">that even if you can't log in to Wordpress so let's wait another few moments and see who we get connected to oh okay so we've got through to real person that was another minute or so later uh I wonder who we got here let's see what they're going to say okay they're still typing they've been typing now for about oh here we go I checked your telling yoursite not accessible could you tell me which website is happening on also have a screenshot there are you're getting so I can check the details sure thing uh</p>
<p id="ember227" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Eduardo let's have a look the air message I'm getting is this one well let let me tell him the site first actually the site is this one this is the site and I do a screenshot like this can I paste into that chat let's see okay let's see what Eduardo can do with this he's typing already it's good sign okay he just stopped typing oh no he's back again good here we go okay Eduardo's come back and he says this happens when you try to update sever plugins or themes and word press generates a file called maintenance that</p>
<p id="ember228" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">was it it's not anything to do the config it's a do maintenance file he's now removed it and it should be working so let me take a look let's see if we can go into WP admin let's just refresh this we're back in jobs all good that was pretty efficient that was pretty good I mean I've been on the chat for less than 10 minutes obviously a little bit of back and forth but you'd expect that but thank you Eduardo it's working excellent support so yeah I'm pretty impressed with that I mean maybe more complex</p>
<p id="ember229" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">issues would take a bit longer but yeah I wasn't able to trick Eder there he was able to fix my problem really quickly there we go that went well I was really impressed with the support that I got from hostinger once I got past the Bots and got connected to Eduardo well he got me up and running really quickly so yeah very impressive support from hostinger the final thing I want to talk about with hostinger is their security features they take security very seriously at hosting and this is reflected in some of the things that</p>
<p id="ember230" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">they offer you with your hosting all their hosting plans come with a free SSL which well that's kind of standard with most host companies to be honest but it's it's a nice thing to know and enables you to serve your website over https so it's all nicely encrypted they've also got that built in malware scanner which that's a nice thing to have you don't see that with many hosting companies where they regularly scanning your website and we'll let you know if there's anything nasty or untoward happening with the higher plans</p>
<p id="ember231" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">you've got that CDN which is the content delivery Network that gives you an extra layer of protection and then of course you've got the regular backups on the low plan it's a weekly backup but on the higher plans you're getting daily backups which is is a really nice thing to have and gives you such a nice feeling inside and that extra peace of mind that if something does go wrong you can easily restore your website the backup interface is actually really easy to use it's part of their H panel you</p>
<p id="ember232" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">can go in there and click a button and trigger a backup whenever you want to you can also restore your website from here if you need to I think all of these features combined with the excellent support that you get with hostinger means that you don't have to worry about your site being hacked or any security issues and if something does go wrong well you've got the backups and you've got that support so it's all going to be fine so we're coming to the end of this review I hope it's helped you make a</p>
<p id="ember233" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">decision when it comes to choosing a hosting company and maybe hosting is going to be the one you choose let me just summarize a few of the key points basically hosting is a fantastic affordable hosting company they offer a really good service for the the price you get the the good performance you get quite a lot of features you get an easyto use control panel and you also get that fantastic support from Eduardo and the team on the downside well there's no phone support but I guess that's not necessary when you got a</p>
<p id="ember234" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">fantastic live chat service the other downside well it's those renewal prices they do jump up quite a bit when it's time to renew but this is standard every hosting company does it and to be fair on hostinger their renewal prices are much lower than many other hosting companies ultimately I think hosting is a great choice for most people especially if you do have multiple small websites but even bigger websites and e-commerce websites will be absolutely fine with hostinger too if you are thinking about moving to hostinger while</p>
<p id="ember235" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">we've got you covered we've got a post on the brainstorm Force website that is a walk through and takes you through how to set up your hosting your hosting with the domain name and everything you need to know do go check out you'll find a link to it in the description and that brings us to the end of this blog who's your favorite hosting company have you ever used hostinger have you ever had a chat with Eduardo via the Live support do let me know Below in the comments I do read all the comments that we get if</p>
